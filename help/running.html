    <h3>Running Kodos</h3>

    Before you can run Kodos you will need to have a recent versions of
python (1.5+, 2.1+ recommended), pyqt(2.3+) and sip (dependent on pyqt).  This document assumes that your system meets these requirements.
<p>

<h3>Prequisites</h3>
If you have not already done so, download the latest version of Kodos from
http://kodos.sourceforge.net
<p>
Unpack the Kodos tgz or zip file that you have downloaded.  This will
create a "kodos" subdirectory which will contain the application and
supprt modules.
<p>

<h3>Running Kodos</h3>
cd into the kodos subdirectory:
<br>
<b>$ cd kodos</b>
<p>
Run the program:<br>
<b>$ python kodos.py</b>
<br>
This assumes that you have a python interpreter executable in your PATH and
that this is the version that pyqt has been compiled against.  It is not 
uncommon for systems to have multiple versions of python installed so you
should ensure that pyqt has been installed for the python interpreter 
that you invoke.  If you have multiple python interpreters and you are unsure 
which one you have installed pyqt for you can try each one to verify:<p>
<b>$ python</b><br>
<b>>>>import qt</b><br>
<i>Traceback .... </i><br>
<p>
<b>$ python2.1</b><br>
<b>>>>import qt</b><br>
<i>>>></i><br>

In the first case above, qt fails to import.  In the second case, qt imports
successfully.<p>
<p>
If you receive an exception traceback upon launching the Kodos application then
it is most likely caused by an improper pyqt installation.  Make sure that
you are using the correct version of python for the version of pyqt that you
are using and that the libraries are installed such that python can find them
(either by placing them in the python site-packages directory or modifying your
PYTHONPATH).  If the qt shared objects are in an unusual place you may also 
have to modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include this directory.<p>

Since there are a variety of reasons why kodos could fail to run considering
it's many dependencies (python, qt, pyqt and sip) there is no way I could 
easily list specific solutions.  If you do come across a situation where you
are unable to run kodos because of these dependenicies and if you find a way 
to resolve it I'd appreciate knowing the initial problems and the solution so
that I can include it here for the reference of others.
