    <h1>Preferences</h1>
Set your <b>Web Browser</b> path.  You can use the <b>...</b> button to use a file dialog to help locate your browser.  The web browser is necessary to access external links within the Python Regex documentation.<p>

The <b>Editor Font</b> allows you to select a desirable font for use within the Kodos editor<p>

The <b>Email Server</b> is required for sending bug reports to the author.  You can submit a bug report under the main <b>Help</b> menu<p>

You can control the number of <b>Recent Files</b> that are displayed at the bottom of the <b>File</b> menu.  The default value is 5.  To display more or less recent files, set this value accordingly.  The recent file list is maintained independtly of this value such that applying a lower value and then a higher value will not purge entries.  That is, if you have 10 files and then set this value to 3 and later set this value to 10, the 10 files will be immediately available for selection .<p>



Clicking <b>apply</b>
or <b>ok</b> will save your preferences and update the Kodos environment.  Clicking <b>cancel</b> will your revert changes.

Saved preferences are automatically loaded upon running Kodos.  Typically, the preferences are saved to a file named "prefs" in the ".kodos" subdirectory.
The ".kodos" subdirectory is usually located under your home directory.
